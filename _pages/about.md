I am currently an Assistant Professor in the VCC Lab at Shenzhen University. Before that, I got my Phd from Beijing Normal University (2019), supervised by A.P. Xin Zheng and Prof. Zhongke Wu. Then, I began my postdoctoral research work (2019~2022) at Nanyang Technological University, supervised by Prof. Weisi Lin (IEEE Fellow).
My interests include Geometric Analysis of Mathmatic, Computer Graphic, 3D Vision, etc. I have published several papers for face recognition, face classification, face modeling, shape analsyis, 3D point cloud and mesh processing. Recently, I am working for point cloud-based semantic analysis and urban scene reconstruction.
